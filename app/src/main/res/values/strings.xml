    <string name="service_description">Popup Blocker is an application that helps to block annoying
        dialog boxes, such as advertising from a mobile operator, notifications about new versions
        of applications, and so on. The application uses Accessibility Service to find dialog boxes
        in the selected packages with specified text and to emulate clicking on specified element.
        \n
        \n
        To customize the work, go to settings, mark the applications you want to track and create
        rules for each of them. The rule consist of text, that should contain a dialog box, and
        text of element to be clicked on ("Ok", "Cancel" ...). Also, instead of pressing an element,
        you can emulate backpress.
        \n
        \n
        After changing the tracking packages, service must be restarted.
